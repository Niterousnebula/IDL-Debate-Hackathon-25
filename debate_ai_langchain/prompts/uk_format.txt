**(MANDATORY FORMAT RULES FOR AI DEBATE SIMULATION, EVALUATION, AND SPEECH GENERATION)**

#### ðŸŸ¦ A. Team Structure and Roles

* **Four teams**, two per side:

  * **Government Bench**:

    * Opening Government (OG): Prime Minister (PM), Deputy PM (DPM)
    * Closing Government (CG): Member of Government (MG), Government Whip (GW)
  * **Opposition Bench**:

    * Opening Opposition (OO): Leader of Opposition (LO), Deputy LO (DLO)
    * Closing Opposition (CO): Member of Opposition (MO), Opposition Whip (OW)

* Each speaker speaks **once**.

* No reply speeches in BP format.

* Teams are ranked **1st to 4th** by judges â€” **no draws or ties**.

#### ðŸŸ¦ B. Speech Order and Durations

1. PM (7 min)
2. LO (7 min)
3. DPM (7 min)
4. DLO (7 min)
5. MG (7 min)
6. MO (7 min)
7. GW (7 min)
8. OW (7 min)

* Grace period: 15 seconds after 7 minutes.
* **No additional time beyond 7:15** is to be considered by judges.

#### ðŸŸ¦ C. Points of Information (POIs)

* Allowed between **minute 1 and 6** of each speech.
* **Not allowed** in the first and last minutes (protected time).
* Max duration: **15 seconds** per POI.
* Diagonal POIs encouraged (e.g., OG to CO).
* **Speakers must take at least 1 POI** when offered.
* Persistent interruption (badgering) is disallowed.

#### ðŸŸ¦ D. Speaker Role Expectations

* **OG (PM, DPM)**: Define motion, provide a case, defend it.

* **OO (LO, DLO)**: Refute OG, offer counter-arguments or counter-model.

* **CG (MG, GW)**: Extend OGâ€™s case with new material (MG), summarize and weigh debate (GW).

* **CO (MO, OW)**: Extend OOâ€™s case (MO), summarize and weigh debate (OW).

* **GW & OW**: Cannot introduce new arguments. Only new angles or deeper analysis allowed.

* **MG/MO** (Member speeches): Must provide a **clear extension** â€” new content not previously offered by their opening team.

#### ðŸŸ¦ E. Debate Prep and Motion Use

* **15 minutes** prep time after motion release.
* Only partners may confer.
* No use of digital devices; **only printed material** allowed.
* Motions may include **info slides** â€” these must be treated as true and known by all.
* Motion types:

  * **Policy Motion**: OG has fiat; Opposition may counter-prop.
  * **Analysis Motion**: Argue truth/value of a statement.
  * **Actor Motion**: Teams debate what a stakeholder should do based on its interests.

#### ðŸŸ¦ F. Judging & Decision Format

* Judges rank teams **1st to 4th** (no ties).
* **Consensus-based ranking** among judges is preferred; otherwise, majority vote.
* **Chair Judge delivers Oral Adjudication (OA)**.
* All teams receive **speaker scores** (0â€“100), aligned with their rank.
* Judges must use the **Ordinary Intelligent Voter (OIV)** lens:

  * Reasonably well-informed, no specialist knowledge, no personal bias.
  * Judges must ignore external knowledge and judge only on in-round material.
  * Persuasiveness = strong argumentation (matter) + clear delivery (manner) + role adherence (method).
* **Contradictions** within a team invalidate the later claim. Contradictions between opening and closing benches are ignored (closing contradicting opening = extension ignored).
* **No new burdens or definitions** may be introduced outside OG.

  * LO may challenge unfair definitions or offer counter-models.
