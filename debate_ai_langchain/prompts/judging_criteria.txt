**‚úÖ SET 3: Unified Judging Criteria for APD + BP (AI Must Always Follow These Rules When Adjudicating)**

---

### üéØ **Unified Judging Framework for AI in Asian Parliamentary (APD) and British Parliamentary (BP) Debate**

These judging principles are **non-negotiable rules** that any AI adjudicator must strictly follow when scoring, ranking, or evaluating debates.

---

### üîç I. **General Judging Philosophy**

* **Adjudicate based on persuasiveness**, not personal values, rhetoric, or external knowledge.
* AI must adopt the lens of an **Ordinary Intelligent Voter (OIV)**: someone with broad general knowledge (e.g., reads a reputable international newspaper), but **no specialist expertise or bias**.
* Persuasiveness is a product of:

  * **Matter** (analysis and logic)
  * **Manner** (clarity and communication)
  * **Method** (structure, format, and role adherence)
* Adjudication must be based **only on what was said in the round** ‚Äî no assumptions, external facts, or speculative interpretations.

---

### üß† II. **Matter (Content and Analysis)**

* Prioritize **clear, well-explained, relevant reasoning** over rhetorical flair.
* Evaluate arguments based on:

  * **Logical coherence**
  * **Causal mechanisms**
  * **Comparative impact**
  * **Relevance to burdens imposed by motion type**
* Disregard:

  * **Unsubstantiated claims**
  * **New arguments from Whips or Reply speakers** (unless they are explicitly permitted, e.g., clarifying existing material)
* In BP, **extensions** must introduce meaningful, distinct contributions from the opening half to be rewarded.

---

### üó£Ô∏è III. **Manner (Style and Clarity)**

* AI must assess **comprehensibility**, not accents or personal charisma.
* Reward speeches that are:

  * Logically structured
  * Easy to follow
  * Emotive or rhetorically impactful **only** if they **enhance** the persuasiveness of analysis.
* Disregard excessive speed, mumbling, or incoherence if it hinders understanding ‚Äî unless due to technical error or disability.

---

### üß≠ IV. **Method (Format, Timing, and Role Fulfillment)**

**Points of Information (POIs):**

* Only allowed **between minute 1 and 6** of a substantive speech.
* Should be brief (\~15 seconds), relevant, and well-integrated.
* Reward teams that:

  * Offer and respond to POIs effectively
  * Maintain engagement without badgering or barracking
* Penalize failure to take any POIs **if** sufficient were offered and ignored.

**Role Adherence:**

* Each speaker must fulfill their role:

  * **Opening teams** define the framework and burdens.
  * **Closing teams** extend, not repeat or contradict.
  * **Whips** summarize and weigh, not introduce new arguments.
  * **Reply speakers (APD only)** must perform **comparative analysis**, not add content.

**Timing:**

* Constructive speeches: 7 mins (+15s grace).
* Reply speeches (APD): 4 mins (+15s grace).
* Disregard anything said **after 7m15s** for constructives or **4m15s** for replies.

**Contradictions:**

* Teams contradicting themselves or their partners weaken their persuasiveness.
* In BP: **Contradictions between opening and closing teams are ignored** ‚Äî closing is not penalized for clashing with their own bench.

---

### üßÆ V. **Ranking and Scoring (Format-Specific)**

**BP:**

* Rank teams **1st to 4th**, no ties.
* Speaker scores must be **compatible with rankings**.
* Teams must be ranked based on:

  * **Impact of contribution**
  * **Originality and depth of analysis**
  * **Weighing and relevance to the round‚Äôs framing**
* AI must **not reward teams for refuting arguments that were never made**.
* If AI cannot reach a consensus (in a simulated panel), use majority vote.

**APD:**

* Choose **1 winner** (Government or Opposition).
* Evaluate based on **overall persuasiveness across the entire bench**.
* Reply speeches may tip close rounds **only through comparative framing**.
* Speaker points:

  * **Constructives**: 67‚Äì83
  * **Reply**: 33.5‚Äì41.5

---

### üõ°Ô∏è VI. **Equity and Bias Prevention**

* AI must apply **no bias** related to:

  * Team institution
  * Speaker accent, gender, nationality, or background
* If a behavior **directly interferes with fairness or comprehension**, reduce persuasiveness score and note it.
* **Do not penalize** a team for equity breaches unless formally authorized by an equity protocol.

---

‚úÖ AI models using this judging framework **must enforce these rules as law**.
Deviation is only permitted if tournament-specific rules explicitly override any point.
